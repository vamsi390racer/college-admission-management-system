College Admission Management System (Project 6)OverviewThis is a console-based application developed in Java to automate and manage the core processes of college admissions. The system handles student registration, calculates merit scores based on subject performance, and provides administrative tools to approve applicants based on merit and course capacity.The project is built around database integration, using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect the Java application logic with a MySQL database for permanent data storage. Maven is used for project and dependency management.üöÄ Technologies UsedCategoryTool / TechnologyVersion / RequirementCore LanguageJavaJDK 17 or higherBuild ToolMavenLatest stable versionDatabaseMySQL ServerRunning instance (default port 3306)ConnectivityJDBCmysql-connector-java (managed by Maven)‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation GuideFollow these steps to set up and run the project locally.Step 1: Database SetupEnsure MySQL Server is running on your machine.Locate the database setup script: src/main/resources/DB_Setup.sql.Execute the entire SQL script in your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench or DBeaver). This creates the CollegeAdmissions database and the Students, Courses, and Applications tables.Step 2: Configure CredentialsThe application needs your database login details to connect.Open the main application file: src/main/java/AdmissionManager.java.Update the DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD variables in the code with your actual local MySQL credentials.// Update these values in AdmissionManager.java
private static final String DB_USER = "YOUR_DB_USERNAME";       
private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "YOUR_DB_PASSWORD"; 
Step 3: Build and RunOpen your terminal or command prompt.Navigate to the project's root directory (where the pom.xml file is located).Use Maven to compile the project and download the required MySQL JDBC driver:mvn clean install
Run the console application:mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="AdmissionManager"
‚úÖ Key Features and LogicThe application provides a command-line interface with the following functions:Student Registration: Allows the user to input personal details and subject scores (Maths, Physics, Chemistry), which are saved to the Students table.Course Application: Automatically calculates the student's Merit Score (average of the three subject scores) and saves the application to the Applications table with a 'PENDING' status.Administrative Approval: Simulates the admission process by selecting the top-scoring 'PENDING' applicants for a given course until the maximum seat capacity is reached. It updates the application status to 'APPROVED' and increments the seat count in the Courses table.
